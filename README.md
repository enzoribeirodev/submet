### submet

### Usage
This is a package to compute the distance between equi-dimensional subspaces.  Each metric used to compute the distance between subspaces is dependent on the singular values of the inner product of the two subspaces.  Given two subspaces, $X$, and $Y$, each of dimension $p$, we can compute the singular values $\sigma_{1}... \sigm_{p}$.  This package implements a variety of metrics, including:

 * Asimov
    $$\begin{align}
    d(X, Y) = 
    $$\end{align}
 * Binet-Cauchy
    $$\begin{align}
    d(X, Y) = 
    $$\end{align}
 * Chordal
 * Fubini-Study
 * Grassmann
 * Martin
 * Procrustes
 * Projection
 * Spectral
